In the hush of morning's grace,
Where dreams and daylight gently trace,
The whispers of the dawn arise,
Painting hues across the skies.

Gentle breezes kiss the trees,
Murmurs soft on silken leaves,
Birdsong weaves a tender tune,
Greeting warmly sun and moon.

Fields awake in golden glow,
Rivers in their splendor flow,
Mountains stand with steadfast pride,
Guardians of the earth so wide.

In this moment, pure and true,
Natureâ€™s beauty shines anew,
Heart and soul in quiet bond,
Lost within the dawn's sweet song.
